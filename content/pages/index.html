    Hello, I'm Rob. I write code remotely <a href="https://zapier.com/jobs/">@Zapier</a>. We use Python with Django and JavaScript with React. I'm currently hacking from my home in Chicago. Most of my work is on <a href="https://github.com/rjauquet">GitHub</a>; I'm ramping up working on some open source projects, too, and you can checkout Zaipier's open source projects <a href="https://zapier.com/oss/">here</a>.

    <br/><br/>

    Currently focusing on board games and writing in my spare time. I'm an ameture sailor, intermediate motorcyclist, and certified computer engineer. I also play a mean Ness on Super Smash Bros. 64.
