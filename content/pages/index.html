    Hello, I'm Rob. I write code remotely <a href="https://zapier.com/jobs/">@Zapier</a> :D

    <br/><br/>

    I do most of my hacking from my home in Chicago, IL, where I'm free from all distractions except for a giant city to explore, Anna, and our dog. It's the best. I'm currently focusing on board games and writing in my spare time, but that changes on a whim. I like to collect hobbies; I'm an extremely ameture sailor, intermediate motorcyclist, and certified computer engineer. I also play a mean Ness on Super Smash Bros. 64, collect vinyl, sew, brew beer, and generally get really excited about anything with an interesting history and engaging present.
